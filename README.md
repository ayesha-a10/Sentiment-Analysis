# Sentiment Analysis – Binary & Multi-Class Classification

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains multiple experiments on **Sentiment Analysis**.  
The goal is to classify textual data into sentiment categories through **comprehensive preprocessing**, **model experimentation**, and **performance evaluation**.

We cover:
1. **Binary Classification** – Positive / Negative
2. **Multi-Class Classification** – Multiple sentiment labels

Models implemented:
- **Naive Bayes** (Baseline)---58% Accuracy
- **LSTM**---86% Accuracy
- **Bi-LSTM**---88% Accuracy
- **BERT**---92-93% Accuracy
- **SQL Keyword-based Sentiment Tagging**
- **Bi-LSTM for Multi-Class Classification**---92% Accuracy

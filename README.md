# Sentiment Analysis â€“ Binary & Multi-Class Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains multiple experiments on **Sentiment Analysis**.  
The goal is to classify textual data into sentiment categories through **comprehensive preprocessing**, **model experimentation**, and **performance evaluation**.

We cover:
1. **Binary Classification** â€“ Positive / Negative
2. **Multi-Class Classification** â€“ Multiple sentiment labels

Models implemented:
